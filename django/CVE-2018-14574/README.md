# Django < 2.0.8 Any URL Jump Vulnerability (CVE-2018-14574)

In Django's default configuration, if the last bit in the matching URL route is /, and the user does not add / when accessing, Django will jump to the request with / by default. (Determined by `django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware`, `APPEND_SLASH` in the configuration item).

In the case where the path starts with `//example.com`, Django does not process it, causing the browser to think that the destination address is an absolute path, eventually causing any URL jump vulnerability.

The exploit condition is that there is a rule in the target `URLCONF` that matches `//example.com`.

## vulnerability environment

Compile and run a django 2.0.7 based website running the following environment:

```
Docker-compose build
Docker-compose up -d
```

After the environment starts, visit `http://your-ip:8000` to view the home page of the website.

## Vulnerability recurrence

Go to `http://your-ip:8000//www.example.com` and return to 301 to jump to `//www.example.com/`:
