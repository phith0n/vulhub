# Apache HTTPD Line Break Parsing Vulnerability (CVE-2017-15715)

Apache HTTPD is an HTTP server that can run PHP web pages via mod_php. There is a parsing vulnerability in the 2.4.0~2.4.29 version. When parsing PHP, `1.php\x0A` will be parsed according to the PHP suffix, resulting in bypassing some server security policies.

## vulnerability environment

Compile and run the vulnerability environment:

```
Docker-compose build
Docker-compose up -d
```

After startup, Apache runs on `http://your-ip:8080`.

## Vulnerability recurrence

Upload a file named 1.php and be blocked:

Insert a `\x0A` after 1.php (note that it can't be `\x0D\x0A`, it can only be a `\x0A`), no longer intercept:

Visit the `/1.php%0a` just uploaded and found that it can be successfully parsed, but this file is not a php suffix, indicating that the target has a parsing vulnerability:
